We are a consulting company (you can find us at [cloudanswers.com](https://cloudanswers.com) ) which focused on Salesforce.com and Heroku projects (and AWS). Our team is globally dispersed and everyone works from home or their local co-working center of choice. Our day to day is usually in slack or google meet/hangouts.

Last year we were doing internal exercises to figure out our passion and two things came up over and over:

1.  Inventing / thinking out of the box

2.  Open Source

At the beginning of 2018 we started holding monthly hackathons internally. Eventually we started inviting people join as judges and then later as team members. We always kept the rules to: 24 hours only, judging at the end, must share your code with the team. At the end of our last hackathon we were discussing how we build some fun stuff but most of it never sees the light of day - so we should open source it. That's how this happened...

We're sponsoring it as a company and participating in it ourselves, but we have a Salesforce-MVP judging pannel with a scoring spreadsheet that will be scored for accuracy at a later point in time, so we think it won't pose a conflict of interest. Of course, we can change the rules if someone outlines a fair reason to do so.

We hope you enjoy hacking with us this month and hope to do this a lot going forward.
