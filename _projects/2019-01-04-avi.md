blurb: Get non blocking notification based on criteria while creating / updating records.
---

A salesforce app that lets you set configurable criteria to send alerts / notification to user. Basically give admins a declarative / setup wizard way to show a toast / alert on records when certain criteria are hit. For example, if you delete an email address from a contact, you might not want to block the user, but you want them to confirm that they meant to do it.
