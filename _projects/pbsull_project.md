blurb: Summarize data like a spreadsheet, natively with Lightning
---

We made a spreadsheet alternative that lives natively in Salesforce. Rather than trying to do your back of napkin estimates, complex summaries, or vlookups in Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets / Apple Numbers, you can use our app to calculate metrics without building out a new complicated data model, importing records, and making more fields for a single report.
