blurb: Select and upload record tree from one Salesfore org to another.
---

A simple tool to help people migrate record with all their related child records to 
other Salesforce orgs. Many a times we run into issues in production and we want to setup
similar data in sandbox environment. While we can use full / partial copy sandboxes, however for developer sandboxes we need to create test either manually or use some external tool to upload the data. What we provided a way to select a bunch of records from production, and upload it to sandbox.
