        <h2>Open + <strong>Open Source</strong></h2>
        <p>
          We are conducting this hackathon open and transparently, so you can
          see all your competitors, submissions, and eventually scores. We all
          use a lot of open source now-a-days so a big part of this is creating
          new open source code that other people can learn from. This also means
          that you will be building your open source portfolio which can help
          you attract employers and employees.

        <h2>Compete for cash prizes</h2>
        <p>
          We seeded the prize pool with $1,500 of our own money so that we have
          a shot at attracting some interesting people that could join our
          contest. We do hackathons in our company every month for joy of
          creating and launching things, and want the winner to feel awarded in
          all ways possible.
